## Description:
The following application uses the React.js library to build my personal portfolio. You can expect to find sections where you can learn about me, view some of my prjoects I completed for the University of Washington Fullstack Bootcamp, view and download a copy of my resume, and submit form data if you wish to contact me. This portfolio is an ongoing project that I will continue to update overtime as I learn more and gain experience. Feel free to have a look around!
    
## Installation:
You can find my portfolio available online and ready to view. Just click [here](https://) to begin to learning more about me.
    
## Usage:

Using the navigation links in the upper right corner, you are also given the options to view some of my completed projects from the University of Washington Fullstack Bootcamp, view and download a copy of my resume, and submit form data if you wish to contact me. If you wish to reach out to me directly, my email address has been added to the footer of the page, as well as links to my LinkedIn profile, my GitHub account, and to my City of Everett ArcGIS Online account to view some of my professional projects.
